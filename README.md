<h1 align="center">README</h1>

In this project I have used HTML and CSS to build the structure and design the styles. I have attached all the necessary code and the icons which I used for styling. All the major stylings were covered in this project such as flex, relative, absolute, media query etc. Go through the HTML file first and accordingly you can get the CSS files later. I'm open for discussions and anysort of suggestions, You can connect with me on LinkedIn.
Thank you!
